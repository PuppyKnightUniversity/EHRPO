The structured temporal electronic health records (EHR) data is identified by <Visit Sequence>. It includes the patient’s multiple visits to medical facilities, capturing diagnosed diseases, laboratory test information, and medication details.
Here is the current patient's <Visit Sequence>:
<Visit 1>:
	[conditions]:
		Pneumonia, organism unspecified
		Pulmonary collapse
		Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, unspecified, with chronic kidney disease stage I through stage IV, or unspecified
		Chronic glomerulonephritis with unspecified pathological lesion in kidney
		Coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery
		Occlusion and stenosis of carotid artery without mention of cerebral infarction
		Pure hypercholesterolemia
		Aortocoronary bypass status
		Long-term (current) use of anticoagulants
	[procedures]:
		Non-invasive mechanical ventilation
	[drugs]:
<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.1% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 1.9% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.1% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

Here is the current patient's <Visit Sequence>:
<Visit 1>:
	[conditions]:
		Rheumatic heart failure (congestive)
		Mitral valve insufficiency and aortic valve insufficiency
		Cardiogenic shock
		Diseases of tricuspid valve
		Anemia, unspecified
		Unspecified essential hypertension
	[procedures]:
		Open and other replacement of mitral valve with tissue graft
		Extracorporeal circulation auxiliary to open heart surgery
		Intraoperative cardiac pacemaker
		Monitoring of cardiac output by other technique
	[drugs]:
<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

Here is the current patient's <Visit Sequence>:
<Visit 1>:
	[conditions]:
		Single liveborn, born in hospital, delivered without mention of cesarean section
		35-36 completed weeks of gestation
		Other preterm infants, 2,500 grams and over
		Need for prophylactic vaccination and inoculation against viral hepatitis
		Observation for suspected infectious condition
	[procedures]:
		Prophylactic administration of vaccine against other diseases
	[drugs]:
<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.2% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.

<Question>: Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital within two weeks? Select one of the following options: A. Yes. B. No.
The following information comes from a clinical EHR analysis tool that supports decision-making based on the patient's EHR. It analyzes historical data and highlights key visits and medical codes across three aspects: conditions, drugs, and procedures.
Each aspect includes:
1.<Visit Importance Analysis>: Marks visits most relevant to understanding the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance visits.
2.<Code Importance Analysis>: Identifies the most important medical codes for that aspect, which are the codes most relevant to the patient's health in that aspect. You should focus more on these high-importance codes.

[EHR Model Prediction Result]: 
	The EHR model predicts a 0.0% probability of readmission within two weeks for this patient.
