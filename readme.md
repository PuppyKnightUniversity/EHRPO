![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PuppyKnight-EHRPO-blue)
-  We want to improve LLM's ablity of EHR reasoning via small EHR traditional model guided training 💯
## Project information 🍁

### What have Done!
- Traditional EHR analysis model (hitanet)
- Visit-level and feature-level attention extration (hitanet)
- Basic LLM inference code for EHR analysis tasks (mortality prediction, readmission prediction)
- Other baseline of EHR analysis model(e.g. Adacare, Concare, RNN, Transformer)

### TODO List:
- Explicit injection prompt to LLM
